# Large Language Models: Fundamentals

## What are Large Language Models?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They represent a breakthrough in natural language processing and have revolutionized how we interact with AI.

## Architecture: The Transformer Revolution

### The Transformer Architecture

```{admonition} Key Innovation
:class: tip

The transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention is All You Need" {cite}`vaswani2017attention`, uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences efficiently and capture long-range dependencies.
```

Key components:
- **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel attention mechanisms for different representation subspaces
- **Position Encoding**: Provides sequence order information
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process attention outputs

### Popular LLM Architectures

1. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
   - Decoder-only architecture
   - Autoregressive text generation
   - Examples: GPT-3, GPT-4, ChatGPT

2. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
   - Encoder-only architecture
   - Bidirectional context understanding
   - Excellent for classification tasks

3. **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**
   - Encoder-decoder architecture
   - All tasks framed as text-to-text
   - Versatile for various NLP tasks

## Training Process

### Pre-training
- **Unsupervised learning** on massive text corpora
- **Next token prediction** for autoregressive models
- **Masked language modeling** for bidirectional models

### Fine-tuning
- **Supervised learning** on specific tasks
- **Instruction tuning** for following human instructions
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**

## Scale and Capabilities

### Model Scale Trends

| Model | Parameters | Training Data | Year |
|-------|------------|---------------|------|
| GPT-1 | 117M | 40GB | 2018 |
| GPT-2 | 1.5B | 40GB | 2019 |
| GPT-3 | 175B | 570GB | 2020 |
| GPT-4 | ~1T* | Unknown | 2023 |

### Emergent Capabilities

As models scale, they develop new capabilities:
- **In-context learning**: Learning from examples in the prompt
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Step-by-step problem solving
- **Few-shot learning**: Performing tasks with minimal examples
- **Code generation**: Writing and debugging code
- **Multimodal understanding**: Processing text, images, and more

## Key Concepts

### Tokens and Tokenization
- **Tokens**: Basic units of text processing (words, subwords, characters)
- **Tokenization**: Converting text into tokens
- **Vocabulary size**: Number of unique tokens the model knows

### Context Window
- **Context length**: Maximum number of tokens the model can process
- **Attention patterns**: How the model relates different parts of the input
- **Memory limitations**: Longer contexts require more computational resources

### Temperature and Sampling
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in generation
- **Top-k sampling**: Choose from k most likely next tokens
- **Top-p (nucleus) sampling**: Choose from tokens comprising p probability mass

## Practical Considerations

### Computational Requirements
- **Training costs**: Millions of dollars for large models
- **Inference costs**: Significant computational resources needed
- **Energy consumption**: Environmental impact considerations

### Limitations
- **Hallucinations**: Generating false or nonsensical information
- **Bias**: Reflecting biases present in training data
- **Lack of real-time knowledge**: Training data cutoffs
- **No true understanding**: Statistical pattern matching vs. comprehension
