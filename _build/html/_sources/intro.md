## UBC Restricted GenAI Tools

### DeepSeek Applications (Hard NO)

‚ö†Ô∏è **UBC Policy on DeepSeek Applications:**

As stated in UBC's official policy on Privacy Matters:

> "The DeepSeek applications, including mobile, desktop and web or browser access (the 'DeepSeek Applications') present a high degree of privacy and security risk. The DeepSeek model (i.e., the underlying, open-source architecture) downloaded from reputable sources is not currently known to be high risk.
> 
> UBC restricts the installation or use of the DeepSeek Applications on any UBC-owned or personal devices that are used for university business or that access a UBC system through user login. Examples include the UBC wireless network, UBC Library systems, Canvas, Workday, VPN, or any other UBC system requiring a username and password. For any other personal devices, UBC strongly recommends against using or installing the DeepSeek Applications."

*Note: All other GenAI tools & models demonstrated are NOT recommended by UBC (but you are NOT restricted from using them)*

## Finding the Best Model for Your Task

### Chatbot Arena

[LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/) is a battle field for different large language generative models. Everytime you prompt a question, 2 anonymous AI model will be asked to answer your question, and you will vote which model gave better response. After you give your vote, the system will reveal the models' names. After millions of pairwise comparisons are made, an Elo-rating algorithm is used to rank the AI models based on people's preferences.

[Text-to-image arena](https://lmarena.ai/?chat-modality=image) uses the same logic, but it is a battle field for different text-to-image generative models. 

- **Free to try all models**
- You can vote and contribute to rankings!
- Great for comparing model performance

## Using Proprietary Models Economically

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
- Pay-per-use model
- More cost-effective for specific tasks
- Programmatic access to models

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Core Techniques
- **Ask AI to think step by step** - Break down complex problems
- **Give AI time to think** - "Take your time and think carefully before answering"
- **Use structured formats** - Request JSON, numbered lists, or bullet points for answers
- **Give AI a persona** - "You are an expert data scientist with 20 years of experience"

### Best Practices
- **Provide clear examples** - Show exactly what format or style you want
- **Ask for explanations** - Don't just get answers, ask about the "why" behind them
- **Use fun analogies** - "Explain MCP using LEGO building blocks"
- **Ask for alternatives** - Get multiple options: "Show me 3 different ways to solve this"

### Communication Tips
- **Set clear constraints** - "You can only answer in 200 words"
- **Be polite** - Good manners really do help! Say "please" and "thank you"
- **Be super specific** - More details = better answers
- **Ask questions in JSON format** - AI loves structured requests

### Context Management
- **Manage context window** - Start new chats for big tasks
- **Avoid overwhelming AI** - AI can get overwhelmed with 20+ messages
