# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The field encompasses various approaches to creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human cognition.

## Historical Context

```{admonition} Timeline
:class: note

- **1950s**: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test
- **1956**: Dartmouth Conference coins the term "Artificial Intelligence"
- **1980s-1990s**: Expert systems and machine learning emerge
- **2010s**: Deep learning revolution begins
- **2020s**: Large language models transform the landscape

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (ANI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Current state of most AI systems
- Examples: recommendation engines, image recognition

### General AI (AGI)
- Human-level intelligence across all domains
- Currently theoretical
- Goal of many AI research efforts

### Superintelligence (ASI)
- Intelligence exceeding human capabilities
- Speculative future development

## Key AI Technologies

### Machine Learning
The subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
AI's ability to understand and generate human language.

### Computer Vision
