# ⛑️ Chapter 1: UBC AI Policies & Approved Tools

## 1. Free + UBC Approved GenAI Tools

As you already know, there are lots of AI tools out there, and **not everything is safe**. For privacy and safety reasons, there are **limited generative AI tools that UBC approves**. 


### 1.1 OpenAI ChatGPT

⚠️ The free version of OpenAI's ChatGPT is one of them, but **UBC recommends not logging in** when you use ChatGPT to avoid exposing your private information to OpenAI, such as emails. 📧

Of course, there are very limited number of requests you can make to ChatGPT without logging in.

- **Website**: [https://chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com)
- **Free version available** (DO NOT login)
- Backend model: GPT-5

### 1.2 Microsoft Copilot

🎉 Luckily, UBC approves another tool which is **Microsoft Copilot**. This is included in your UBC student account with Microsoft!

You have **two ways** to access Microsoft Copilot:

#### 🌐 Option 1: Edge Browser Sidebar 
- Download the [Edge web browser](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ)
- Log in using your **@student.ubc.ca** account 
- Use the **Copilot sidebar** which is integrated directly in the browser

#### 💻 Option 2: Website Interface 
- Simply use the **Microsoft Copilot organization tool**: [https://copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
- This is a website user interface that can be opened in **any browser**

## 2. 🚨 UBC Restricted GenAI Tools (Important Policy Information)

### 2.1 🛑 DeepSeek Applications (Strictly Prohibited)

UBC does have a **strong restriction** with the use of DeepSeek. 

🚫 **UBC restricts the installation and use of ANY DeepSeek applications**, including:
- 📱 Applications you can install on your **phone**
- 💻 Applications you can install on your **desktop** 
- 🌐 Applications you can access through **web browsers**

#### 🔍 Important Distinction: Applications vs. Model

I do want to highlight that **this restriction only applies to applications, but NOT the model itself**.

✅ **What IS allowed:**
- DeepSeek is an **open-source model**, meaning you can download the entire model from a reputable source onto your computer
- Downloading the model and using it locally is completely fine
- The underlying open-source architecture is not considered high risk

#### 📋 Official UBC Policy

As stated in UBC's official policy on Privacy Matters:

*Note: All other GenAI tools & models are NOT recommended by UBC due to privacy and safety reasons (but you are NOT restricted from using them)*
